      {
        question: "Which devices can capture contract worker attendance?",
        answer:
      "Face terminals, fingerprint readers, AI-based CCTV attendance, QR and card readers, and the mobile app with GPS validation — all feeding one Iddion RegX attendance stream under a single worker identity. Mixed hardware across gates and sites needs no additional configuration, and a worker enrolled once is recognised by every method.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can shift and OT rules differ per contractor?",
        answer:
      "Yes. Shift windows, OT thresholds, week-offs, and leave policies are configured per contractor, worker category, and site, with state-aware statutory rules applied automatically. Iddion RegX evaluates every punch against the rules that apply to that worker, so no one interprets a roster manually at shift end.",      },
      {
        question: "How does the system handle the 9-day continuous attendance rule?",
        answer:
      "Iddion RegX tracks continuous attendance per worker and alerts HR before the threshold is crossed, leaving time to schedule the mandatory rest day rather than discovering the breach afterwards. These alerts run on the same engine that populates Form V and Form XIII in CLRA compliance software.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do verified hours flow to payroll automatically?",
        answer:
          "Yes — approved attendance and OT flow directly to contractor payroll and invoice reconciliation, so what's paid always traces to what the gates recorded.",
      },
        {
    question: "How are missed or single punches handled?",
    answer:
      "Missing punch-outs are raised as exceptions rather than defaulting to a full shift — which is where unearned hours usually enter payroll. Supervisors resolve each one with a reason code, and Iddion RegX logs the original event, the correction, and who approved it.",
  },

   {
    question: "Can attendance be captured at sites without biometric devices?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The mobile app captures face-verified attendance with GPS validation where there's no fixed hardware, and CCTV-based capture works where cameras exist but terminals aren't practical. Every method writes to the same Iddion RegX attendance record.",
  },
    {
    question: "How is overtime calculated and controlled?",
    answer:
      "OT is computed from actual punch-out time against the registered shift end — not from contractor declarations. Hours beyond the configured threshold require digital supervisor approval before becoming payable, and unapproved OT never reaches the invoice. This closes all three leakage types together: unauthorised OT, ghost OT, and unclaimed legitimate OT.",
  },

    {
    question: "Does it handle leave for contract workers?",
    answer:
      "Yes — leave types, eligibility, and approval flows are configured per contractor and category, including statutory weekly-off tracking. Leave and attendance share one record, so an approved absence isn't flagged and doesn't count toward shift headcount.",
  },
    {
    question: "Can we see live headcount on the floor right now?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Iddion RegX shows present-on-site headcount live by gate, contractor, shift, and area. Beyond shift planning, this is the number that matters during an emergency evacuation, when the muster list has to reflect who actually entered rather than who was rostered.",
  },
   {
    question: "What happens when a worker's gate pass or documents expire mid-cycle?",
    answer:
      "Validity is checked at entry, not at month-end. A worker with expired induction, medical fitness, or licence is flagged and can be blocked at the gate — and because the block happens before the punch, no attendance record is created and no hours reach payroll.",
  },
    {
    question: "How does attendance data reach contractor invoices?",
    answer:
      "Contractor invoices are matched line-by-line against gate-verified headcount and approved OT in Iddion RegX, so discrepancies surface before payment rather than during an audit. Finance stops reconciling manually and starts reviewing exceptions.",
  },
   {
    question: "Can rosters be planned in advance and adjusted per site?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Rosters are built per site, shift, contractor, and trade, with auto-rostering suggesting allocations against required strength. Changes apply to attendance rules immediately, so a mid-week adjustment doesn't generate exception noise.",

   faq: [
  {
    question: "What is CLRA compliance software?",
    answer:
      "CLRA compliance software automates the obligations a principal employer carries under the Contract Labour (Regulation & Abolition) Act: maintaining Form V and Form XIII registers, tracking contractor licence validity and headcount caps per establishment, monitoring continuous-attendance thresholds, and generating statutory returns. Iddion RegX does this from live gate data, so registers are outputs of operations rather than month-end reconstruction.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which registers are maintained digitally?",
    answer:
      "Form V, Form XIII, muster rolls, and wage registers, with state-specific formats where the applicable rules differ. Each entry traces to the gate event or payroll record that produced it, so a register can be defended line by line rather than merely produced.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it track contractor licences and headcount caps?",
    answer:
      "Yes — licence number, expiry date, and permitted headcount per establishment, with alerts before expiry and flags when deployment approaches the cap. A deployment that would breach the licensed strength is caught before the worker enters, which is the only point at which it's still cheap to fix. Licence data is maintained in contractor management.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the 9-day rule alert?",
    answer:
      "Continuous attendance is tracked per worker per site, and HR is alerted before the threshold is reached so the weekly rest day can be scheduled in time. The underlying attendance data comes from attendance and leave management.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can it generate statutory returns automatically?",
    answer:
      "Returns are prepared from live register and payroll data in statutory format, ready for review and filing. Filing remains a human-approved step — a generated return still needs an accountable signatory, and the system is built around that rather than around it.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does this help during a labour inspection?",
    answer:
      "Every register, licence, and gate event sits in one repository tagged by site, contractor, and period, so an inspection request is answered with a filtered export instead of a search across files and emails. For PSU and defence establishments facing short-notice inspections, this is usually the deciding capability.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if we operate across multiple states with different rules?",
    answer:
      "Registers and thresholds are configured per state, so each establishment follows its applicable rules while corporate compliance sees a consolidated view. Multi-state operations are where manual compliance breaks first, because one team ends up maintaining several rule sets by memory.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from a document management system?",
    answer:
      "A document system stores what you upload; Iddion RegX generates the record from the event. The distinction matters because most compliance failures aren't missing documents — they're timing failures, where the register was accurate on the day it was compiled and wrong by the day it was needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it enforce compliance or only report it?",
    answer:
      "Both, when paired with gate compliance. Reporting tells you a contractor's licence lapsed; enforcement stops their workers at the barrier until it's restored. Reporting alone leaves the gap between knowing and acting, which is where inspection findings live.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about PF and ESI compliance?",
    answer:
      "Deductions are computed per worker and matched against contractor challan evidence in challan reconciliation, so contractor defaults surface before they become the principal employer's liability under CLRA.",
  },
  {
    question: "We're not sure where our compliance currently stands. Where do we start?",
    answer:
      "With a CLRA compliance audit — a scored assessment of registers, licences, records, and enforceability across your sites. Most plants find the gaps are narrower and more specific than feared, which makes remediation a project rather than an overhaul.",

  {
    question: "What sources are checks run against?",
    answer:

  {
    question: "What does 'unable to verify' mean for a worker's gate status?",

      "Re-verification schedules are configured per worker category and trigger automatically. When a check nears expiry, Iddion RegX alerts and starts the re-verification workflow. If the check expires before a new result returns, gate access is suspended automatically — the same enforcement mechanism as an expired medical clearance.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does verification status control site access?",
    answer:
      "BGV status is a live gate rule: pending or expired means no entry, enforced at the barrier rather than tracked in a monthly report. Status changes take effect at the next gate attempt without any manual update to security.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we set different verification requirements by role or site?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A housekeeping worker, a hot-work fitter, and a worker entering a defence establishment carry different requirement sets, configured per category and site. Required checks are hard blocks; informational checks log findings without stopping deployment.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does this relate to InOps standalone BGV service?",
    answer:
      "This module is verification built into the platform — checks run automatically as part of onboarding and results enforce gate rules without a separate process. If you need checks without deploying the full CLMS — per-check pricing, bulk upload, contractor bench packages — see background verification services.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can verification run in parallel with other onboarding steps?",
    answer:
      "Yes — running verification concurrently with medical fitness and induction is how Iddion RegX compresses onboarding from days to hours. Workers are cleared as results return rather than waiting for all steps to complete sequentially. See the onboarding module for how the parallel steps are managed end to end.",

faq: [
  {
    question: "Can Iddion RegX track CLRA licence limits per contractor?",
    answer:
      "Yes — licence validity and permitted headcount are tracked per contractor per establishment, with alerts before expiry and flags when deployment approaches the licensed cap. Most plants discover they're over cap only when an inspector counts; this makes the headroom visible daily.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when a contractor's licence lapses?",
    answer:
      "The contractor is flagged across dashboards and registers immediately, and with gate compliance enabled, their workers can be blocked at entry until the licence is restored — with every denial logged. The alternative is discovering the lapse weeks later, with attendance records already showing unlicensed deployment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it verify contractors' statutory remittances?",
    answer:
      "Contractor PF and ESI challan evidence is captured against each cycle and matched to computed liabilities, so gaps surface before they become the principal employer's problem. Under CLRA, contractor defaults can fall back on you — this is where that exposure becomes visible.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we compare contractor performance across sites?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Scorecards cover attendance reliability, compliance flags, document currency, OT patterns, and incident history per contractor across every site they serve — so procurement sees vendor quality alongside commercial terms rather than after a problem.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a blacklisted worker be re-submitted under a different contractor?",
    answer:
      "No — that's the point of holding blacklists at the worker-identity level rather than per contractor. A worker blocked for a safety violation or security incident stays blocked across your sites regardless of which contractor presents them next, because the block attaches to their biometric identity.",
  },
  {
    question: "What documents does the system track per contractor?",
    answer:
      "CLRA licence and headcount cap, commercial agreement and validity dates, insurance certificates, PF/ESI registration and challan evidence, work orders and scope, plus site-specific approvals. Expiry alerts run on all of them, so renewals happen before lapses rather than after notices.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does contractor data connect to worker records?",
    answer:
      "Every worker is mapped to their contractor, work order, site, department, and cost centre — so attendance, wages, and compliance records roll up per contractor automatically. When a worker moves between contractors, the history follows the worker while the billing follows the contractor.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens at contractor exit or contract closure?",
    answer:
      "Workers under that contractor are de-provisioned — gate access revoked, biometric enrollments deactivated — and the compliance record is retained for the statutory period. This closes the gap where departed contractors' workers keep valid gate credentials for months.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we onboard a new contractor before their documents are complete?",
    answer:
      "You can register them, but deployment can be gated on document completeness — so a contractor without a valid licence or insurance can't move workers onto site. Configurable per site, since some plants allow provisional entry under supervision and others don't.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does this help during a labour inspection?",
    answer:
      "Every field an inspector asks for — licences, registers, headcount against cap, remittance evidence, worker-to-contractor mapping — is current in one system and exportable. The difference is a same-day audit response instead of a three-week reconstruction from emails and folders.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many contractors can it handle?",
    answer:
      "Multi-site plants running dozens of contractors simultaneously are the normal case, with per-contractor and consolidated views across sites. Scale is a configuration matter, not a licensing constraint.",

  },
  {
    question: "Can contractors see their own payroll data?",

  {
    question: "What happens when a worker's attendance is disputed after payroll runs?",

  },
  {
    question: "How does this reduce the principal employer's statutory exposure?",
    answer:
      "Under CLRA, contractor defaults on wages and statutory dues can fall back on the principal employer.

 faq: [
  {
    question: "What KPIs does the CXO dashboard show?",
    answer:
      "Contractor headcount and spend by site, compliance posture with open risks, OT and cost-leakage trends, invoice-versus-verified deltas, contractor scorecards, and cross-site comparisons — all computed from live gate data rather than submitted reports.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the dashboard real-time?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Iddion RegX reads from the same attendance and compliance engine that runs the gates, so the headcount you see at 9 AM reflects what the readers recorded at shift change. There is no month-end compilation step and no export cycle to wait for.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can data be exported for board reviews?",
    answer:
      "Yes — scheduled and on-demand board exports, using the same numbers the plant sees, aggregated rather than reformatted. Because the source is one engine, the figure in the board pack matches the figure the plant head can defend.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does leadership see cost leakage they couldn't see before?",
    answer:
      "Leakage is invisible in aggregate because totals look plausible. The dashboard surfaces the deltas instead: invoiced headcount against gate-verified headcount, OT claimed against OT approved, and site-to-site variance on the same metrics. A plant running 15% higher OT than its peers with the same output is a question worth asking, and it only appears when sites are comparable.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we compare performance across plants and contractors?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Sites, contractors, and cost centres are benchmarked on the same definitions — attendance reliability, compliance score, OT ratio, cost per verified hour — so comparison isn't distorted by each plant measuring differently.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who can see what?",
    answer:
      "Access is role-based: CXOs see the enterprise rollup, plant heads drill into their own site, finance sees the invoice and deduction picture, compliance sees register and licence status. Everyone reads from one dataset, which removes the reconciliation meetings that exist purely to agree on whose number is right.",
  },
  {
    question: "What alerts reach leadership, and how?",
    answer:
      "Exception-first: licence expiries approaching cap or lapse, compliance breaches, unusual OT clusters, and invoice-versus-attendance variance beyond threshold. Alerts are pushed rather than waiting to be found, with mobile access so a plant escalation doesn't wait for someone to open a laptop.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work across multiple plants and states?",
    answer:
      "Yes — multi-site is the default architecture. Site-level, regional, and enterprise views come from the same records, including where different states impose different statutory rules, so consolidation doesn't require normalising four spreadsheets first.",
  },
  {
    question: "How far back does the data go?",
    answer:
      "Historical attendance, compliance, and cost data is retained for trend analysis and statutory retention periods, so year-on-year and pre-versus-post-deployment comparisons run on your own records rather than estimates.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does leadership actually do differently with this?",
    answer:
      "Three things, based on how it gets used: they question OT variance between comparable plants, they see licence and register exposure before an inspection rather than after a notice, and they hold contractors to comparable scorecards at renewal instead of renewing on relationship. The dashboard's value is less about seeing more and more about the questions it makes askable.",

  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from dashboards and reports?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: "When are discrepancies caught?",
    answer:
      "Before payment and before the statutory deadline — not in a later audit. Each flag carries its evidence: the worker, the specific punch or absence, and the billed-versus-approved amount, so resolution is a records conversation rather than a negotiation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How large are typical discrepancies?",
    answer:
      "Industry experience puts contractor invoice discrepancy at 25–30% of line items before automated matching. The rate typically falls sharply within the first billing cycles, largely because contractors adjust once they know the gate data is being checked.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this replace our AP process?",
    answer:
      "No — it feeds it. Verified invoices flow to your existing AP or finance system with the reconciliation evidence attached, so approval happens on checked numbers instead of trust.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does the principal employer care about a contractor's PF and ESI challans?",
    answer:
      "Because under CLRA, contractor defaults on statutory dues can fall back on the principal employer. Matching challans against computed liabilities means you hold independent evidence of what was owed and what was actually remitted, rather than relying on the contractor's assurance — the same records that feed CLRA compliance software.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when a contractor's challan doesn't match?",
    answer:
      "The variance is flagged with its worker-level detail and assigned for resolution with an owner and a deadline. Unresolved variances stay visible against that contractor's record, so a pattern of shortfalls becomes a procurement question at renewal rather than a surprise at audit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can it handle multiple contractors across states with different thresholds?",

      "Yes — state-wise ESI thresholds and applicable rules are configured per site, so multi-state operations reconcile against the correct parameters for each establishment instead of one blanket rule.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does it know what the invoice should say?",
    answer:
      "From the gate, not the contractor. Verified attendance produces headcount and hours; approved OT produces the overtime component; configured rates produce the value. The expected invoice is computed from records that existed before the invoice arrived — which is what makes the comparison meaningful.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does finance actually get back?",
    answer:
      "The hours currently spent matching invoices to musters manually, and a close cycle that runs on exceptions rather than full review. The secondary gain is negotiating position: a contractor discussion backed by per-worker gate evidence ends faster than one backed by a spreadsheet.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there an audit trail?",
    answer:
      "Every reconciliation run records what was matched, what was flagged, who resolved it, and on what basis. That trail is exportable for internal audit, statutory inspection, or a contractor dispute — which is usually where it earns its keep.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if a contractor disputes a flagged item?",
    answer:
      "The flag opens with its evidence attached, so the dispute is resolved against the underlying gate events rather than by escalation.

  {
    question: "What is a gate pass management system?",
    answer:
      "A gate pass management system issues and enforces digital entry authorisations for workers and contractors at industrial sites. Each pass is tied to a biometric identity, a contractor, a permitted zone, and a shift window — so entry isn't a badge check but a verification that this specific worker is currently authorised to be here.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the system check before letting a worker in?",
    answer:
      "Iddion RegX evaluates four rule families at every entry: statutory (CLRA licence validity, Form V headcount cap, continuous-attendance threshold), safety (induction validity, medical fitness, job-specific certification such as hot work or confined space), shift (permitted hours, zone, and site), and identity (background verification status, blacklist, and duplicate-identity checks). Any failing check is evaluated before the barrier releases.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does a failed check always stop the worker?",
    answer:
      "No — that would be unworkable in a live plant. Rules run in one of three modes: hard block where entry is refused outright, soft warn where entry proceeds with the exception logged for follow-up, and supervisor override where a named authoriser can permit entry with a recorded reason. Sites typically hard-block statutory and safety rules and soft-warn on documentation gaps.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a blocked worker re-enter under a different contractor?",
    answer:
      "No. Blocks attach to the worker's biometric identity, not to their contractor relationship — so a worker blocked for a safety violation, security incident, or failed verification stays blocked across your sites even if a different contractor submits them next month. This is the gap that paper gate passes and card systems cannot close.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when a contractor's licence expires mid-shift cycle?",
    answer:
      "The licence lapse flags immediately in contractor management, and their workers are refused entry at the next shift until it's restored. The alternative — discovering the lapse weeks later — means attendance records already show unlicensed deployment, which is exactly what an inspector looks for.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does it enforce CLRA headcount caps?",
    answer:
      "Deployed headcount per contractor per establishment is tracked live against the licensed cap. As deployment approaches the limit the system warns, and entries that would breach it are refused. Most plants only discover a cap breach when someone counts during an inspection.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it need turnstiles, or does it work with existing gates?",
    answer:
      "Both. With turnstiles or flap barriers, enforcement is physical — the arm doesn't turn. Without them, the terminal denies and alerts security, which works where a guard controls the gate. Physical enforcement is stronger, but the rules engine is the same either way.",
  },
  {
    question: "What record does a rejection leave?",
    answer:
      "Every denial is logged with the worker, contractor, gate, timestamp, the specific rule that failed, and any override with its authoriser and reason. That rejection trail is often more valuable at audit than the entry log — it demonstrates the control was operating, not just documented.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does this satisfy tender requirements for induction before gate pass issuance?",
    answer:
      "PSU and defence tenders increasingly require that safety induction, medical fitness, and verification are completed before a gate pass is issued. Iddion RegX enforces this as a system rule rather than a process instruction — the pass cannot be issued or used until the prerequisites are recorded, and the evidence is exportable per worker.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does gate data automatically become the compliance record?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every event — entry, exit, zone change, rejection — writes to the statutory record in real time, so Form XIII entries, headcount totals, and attendance logs are current to the last punch. There's no transfer step between the gate log and the register, which is where most reconciliation errors originate. See CLRA compliance software.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about visitors, drivers, and vehicles?",
    answer:
      "Visitor passes issued through visitor management run on the same lanes and rules engine with their own zone permissions and host approval. Vehicle access is handled separately through barriers and ANPR.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to deploy at an existing plant?",
    answer:
      "Where biometric terminals and gates already exist, deployment is largely configuration — mapping rules to gates and loading contractor and worker records. Where hardware is being added, timelines follow the gate installation. The longer path is usually agreeing which rules run hard versus soft, which is a policy conversation rather than a technical one.",

   faq: [
  {
    question: "What does digital onboarding include for contract workers?",
    answer:
      "Digital intake of worker details and documents in the worker's language, Aadhaar-based offline identity verification with consent, PAN and UAN checks, background verification, medical fitness recording, induction scheduling, biometric enrollment, and assignment to contractor, site, shift, and cost centre. Iddion RegX runs the verification steps in parallel rather than sequentially, which is where the time saving comes from.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a worker be blocked at the gate until onboarding is complete?",
    answer:
      "Yes — incomplete onboarding is a blocking rule. A worker whose verification, medical fitness, or induction is outstanding is refused entry automatically through gate compliance. The gate holds the line rather than an HR follow-up loop, which is the difference between a policy and a control.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is offboarding handled for contract workers?",
    answer:
      "On separation, the gate pass is revoked and biometric access deactivated on the last working day, PPE and asset returns are tracked, outstanding dues are flagged before settlement, and statutory closure is computed from the same attendance and wage records used during employment — not reconstructed in a spreadsheet at exit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does offboarding matter as much as onboarding?",
    answer:
      "Because unrevoked access is a live credential. A worker who left eight months ago with an active biometric enrollment can still open a gate and generate an attendance record. This is precisely how fleets accumulate the stale identities a biometric database audit finds — often several times the active headcount.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the system handle bulk intake for shutdowns?",
    answer:
      "Yes — batch intake is the design case. Hundreds of workers are registered and verified in parallel, with cleared workers activated as results return rather than waiting for the full batch. Shutdown and ramp mobilisation is where sequential paper onboarding fails most visibly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is offboarding data linked to compliance registers?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Exits update CLRA registers and headcount records automatically, so a contractor's deployed strength reflects reality rather than accumulated departures — which also keeps licence-cap monitoring accurate.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to a worker who returns later under a different contractor?",
    answer:
      "Their identity, verification history, induction, and medical records are retained, so re-onboarding is re-attestation rather than starting over. Their previous deployments — including under other contractors — remain visible, which matters when someone was blocked or exited for cause.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who does the data entry — our HR team or the contractor?",
    answer:
      "Contractors submit worker packets through a guided mobile flow with document-quality checks at capture, so unreadable or incomplete submissions are caught at source. Your team reviews exceptions instead of chasing paperwork, which is usually the difference between one HR coordinator and three.",
  },
  {
    question: "What documents does the checklist cover, and can it vary?",
    answer:
      "The checklist adapts by worker category, contractor, plant, and applicable state rules — a hot-work fitter's requirements differ from a housekeeping worker's, and state requirements differ across plants. Both are configured rather than remembered.",
  },
  {
    question: "What audit trail exists across the lifecycle?",
    answer:
      "A continuous per-worker record: what was verified and when, who approved each step, when the gate pass was issued and revoked, which assets were returned, and how final settlement was computed. Auditors see one thread from first document to last payment rather than two filing systems that have to be joined by hand.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is worker consent and personal data handled?",
    answer:
      "Consent is captured digitally at intake in the worker's language before any verification runs or biometric template is created. Identity documents, verification results, and bank details are access-controlled with policy-configurable retention, aligned with DPDP Act obligations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does final settlement include statutory closure?",
    answer:
      "Final settlement is computed from verified attendance and wage records, with statutory components — PF, ESI, and gratuity where applicable — calculated from the same source rather than re-entered. Finance receives the computed closure without a manual handoff from HR.",
