  {
    question: "What is a face recognition attendance system?",
    answer:
      "A face recognition attendance system uses an industrial-grade terminal to identify workers by their facial geometry at the gate — recording entry and exit times without a card, PIN, or fingerprint press. InOps face terminals support liveness detection to prevent photo spoofing and are engineered for high-ambient-light factory environments. Each event is tagged to a worker, contractor, and shift, feeding payroll and CLRA compliance records in real time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a biometric attendance machine?",
    answer:
      "A biometric attendance machine is a hardware device that authenticates a worker's identity — by face, fingerprint, or both — and records a time-stamped attendance event. In industrial deployments the machine is mounted at the gate or shop-floor entry, operates without network dependency (events buffer locally and sync on reconnection), and integrates with workforce management software to produce payroll-ready attendance data.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a face attendance machine and a fingerprint attendance system?",
    answer:
      "A face attendance machine is touchless — the worker looks at the terminal and is identified without physical contact, making it faster in high-traffic gate scenarios and more hygienic in food-processing or pharma environments. A fingerprint attendance system requires the worker to press their finger on a sensor, which is marginally slower per transaction but performs reliably across a wider range of lighting conditions. InOps supplies and integrates both; most plants use face terminals at gates and fingerprint readers at secondary access points.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does biometric attendance integrate with contract labour payroll?",
    answer:
      "InOps face and fingerprint terminals push attendance events in real time to the InOps CLMS platform. Each event is tagged to a contractor, site, and shift — the data flows directly into payroll calculation, eliminating manual timesheets and preventing buddy punching. Contractor invoices are reconciled line-by-line against the biometric record before payment.",
  },
  {
    question: "What biometric attendance machines does InOps supply?",
    answer:
      "InOps supplies ZKTeco, eSSL, and Realtime face recognition terminals, fingerprint readers, RFID and card readers, tripod turnstiles, flap barriers, full-height turnstiles, and CCTV-integrated AI attendance cameras. All hardware integrates with the InOps CLMS and HRIS attendance engine.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do face recognition terminals work in outdoor or high-light factory environments?",
    answer:
      "Yes. InOps biometric terminals are rated for industrial environments — they handle direct sunlight, high ambient light at factory gates, and wide temperature ranges. Liveness detection and infrared sensing ensure accurate reads regardless of lighting conditions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does face recognition attendance prevent contractor overbilling?",
    answer:
      "Each face recognition event is tagged to a specific enrolled worker, their contractor agency, and their shift. When the contractor submits their invoice, InOps CLMS reconciles every line item against the biometric gate record. A worker billed but not present has no biometric event — the discrepancy is flagged before payment. Plants report invoice accuracy rising to near 100% from the first billing cycle on InOps.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a biometric terminal goes offline at a factory gate?",
    answer:
      "InOps terminals store attendance events locally during network outages and sync automatically on reconnection. Offline buffer events are processed without creating duplicates or attendance gaps. For multi-gate plants, offline events from one gate do not affect attendance recording at other gates on the same deployment.",
