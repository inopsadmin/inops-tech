  {
    question: "What is a biometric device and how does it work for attendance?",
    answer:
      "A biometric device identifies a person by a physical characteristic — most commonly face or fingerprint — rather than by a card or PIN. For attendance it captures that identity at entry and exit and records the timestamp, so working hours are tied to a verified person rather than a transferable credential. The device sends each event to attendance software, where it becomes a shift record and eventually a payroll input.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which is better for factories — fingerprint or face recognition?",
    answer:
      "Face recognition, in most industrial settings. Fingerprint readers fail on dry, damaged, oily or dirty fingers, which describes the hands of most manual workers by mid-shift. Every failed punch becomes a manual entry, and every manual entry becomes a payroll dispute. Fingerprint devices remain sensible for offices and low-throughput indoor points where hands are clean and volumes are modest.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a biometric attendance machine cost?",
    answer:
      "Cost depends on modality, throughput, environment rating and volume. Fingerprint readers sit at the entry level, face terminals cost more per unit, and turnstile-integrated installations carry civil and installation costs alongside the device. We quote against a site survey rather than a price list, because the same headcount at two different gates often needs different hardware.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which biometric device brands do you supply?",
    answer:
      "ZKTeco, eSSL and Realtime, plus turnstiles, flap barriers and access controllers. We also maintain and integrate mixed-brand estates originally supplied by others, which is the normal situation at plants that have bought hardware over several years.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can biometric devices integrate with our existing attendance or HR software?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Devices feed the InOps attendance engine, and verified data can be exported to existing HR and payroll systems. Where a plant already runs an HRMS, the devices become the capture layer rather than a parallel system.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many devices does a site need?",
    answer:
      "Determined by peak throughput, not headcount. A gate handling 800 workers within a 20-minute shift change needs several lanes or camera-based capture; the same 800 arriving across two hours may need one device. The site survey sizes this, and getting it wrong is the most common cause of queue complaints after deployment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do biometric devices work without internet connectivity?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Devices store punches locally and sync when the connection returns, which matters at remote plants, project sites and locations with unreliable links.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a device fails at a critical gate?",
    answer:
      "Multi-lane gates continue on the remaining readers. Single-reader gates are the real risk, which is why identifying single points of failure is part of both deployment planning and AMC onboarding. Sites running mobile or camera-based capture can also fall back to those methods while a terminal is down.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can one worker be enrolled once and recognised everywhere?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A single enrolment activates the worker's identity across every device on site — gate terminals, canteen counters, attendance points — and across plants in a multi-site deployment. Workers moving between sites or contractors are not re-enrolled, which matters most in contract workforces where movement is constant.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is worker consent and biometric data handled?",
    answer:
      "Consent is captured digitally at enrolment, in the worker's preferred language, before any biometric template is created. Templates are access-controlled with configurable retention, and handling aligns with DPDP Act obligations. Workers can raise queries through the same channel used for enrolment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are biometric templates the same as storing fingerprints or photographs?",
    answer:
      "No. Devices store a mathematical template derived from the biometric, not the image itself, and the template cannot be reversed into a usable fingerprint or photograph. This distinction matters when explaining the system to workers and works committees.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who maintains the devices after installation?",
    answer:
      "Devices are covered under biometric AMC — preventive maintenance, remote monitoring, firmware updates and on-site engineer support across every site under one contract, including devices originally supplied by other vendors.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we add devices later without redoing everything?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Devices are added to the existing estate and inherit the same worker identities and rules. Adding a gate does not mean re-enrolling a workforce, which is one of the practical reasons to standardise the platform even when hardware brands differ.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a registered device (RD service) and do we need one?",
    answer:
      "Registered Device service applies to Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, where UIDAI requires devices to be registered and encrypted at source. It is relevant where Aadhaar authentication is specifically required; standard attendance and access control do not depend on it.",
