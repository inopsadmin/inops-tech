    question: "What is fixed asset management software?",
    answer:
      "Fixed asset management software is a system for tracking an organisation's physical assets — machinery, equipment, devices, vehicles, furniture, and infrastructure — through their full lifecycle: acquisition, deployment, maintenance, depreciation, and disposal. It replaces spreadsheet-based asset registers with a live, searchable database that triggers maintenance schedules, computes depreciation, and produces audit-ready records for finance and statutory compliance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can it track biometric device AMC status?",
    answer:
      "Yes. InOps manages a fleet of 3,000+ biometric attendance devices (face terminals, fingerprint readers, QR scanners) across 70+ industrial sites. Each device is a fixed asset with a purchase date, warranty period, AMC schedule, and assigned site. The platform tracks AMC renewal dates, logs technician visits, and escalates unresolved downtime — so attendance-critical hardware is never missed in a maintenance cycle.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does fixed asset tracking work for multi-site industrial operations?",
    answer:
      "Each asset is assigned to a site and custodian in the central registry. When an asset moves between sites or departments, a digital transfer record is created, updating location and custody instantly. Group-level finance sees the full register across all plants; plant-level teams see only their site's assets. Physical verification can be run per site independently, with reconciliation rolled up at group level.",
  },
  {
    question: "What depreciation methods are supported?",
    answer:
      "InOps fixed asset management supports both Straight-Line Method (SLM) and Written Down Value (WDV) depreciation, aligned with Companies Act 2013 Schedule II useful-life rates and Income Tax Act depreciation rates. Asset-wise depreciation schedules can be exported for statutory audit and tax filing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can fixed asset records integrate with our ERP or accounting system?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Fixed asset data — additions, disposals, depreciation charges — can be exported in standard formats or pushed via API to ERP and accounting systems (SAP, Tally, Oracle, and others). Asset acquisition entries, depreciation journals, and disposal proceeds flow into the GL without manual re-entry.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does InOps handle asset disposal and write-off?",
    answer:
      "Disposal workflows capture the disposal date, proceeds (if sold), and authorisation trail. The asset is removed from the active register and depreciation stops from the disposal date. Scrapped assets generate a write-off record with approvals logged for audit. All historical data is retained for the statutory retention period.",

              In industrial operations, fixed assets span a wide range: CNC machines, transformers, forklifts,
              biometric terminals at plant gates, CCTV cameras, HVAC units, and more. Each carries a purchase cost,
              depreciation schedule, maintenance obligation, and compliance footprint. Tracking these in spreadsheets
              means missed AMC renewals, phantom assets on the books, and audit findings that could have been avoided.

            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600 sm:text-lg">
              InOps fixed asset management replaces the spreadsheet with a live registry — tagged at acquisition,
