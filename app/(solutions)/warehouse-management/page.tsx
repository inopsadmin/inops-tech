  {
    question: "What is warehouse management software?",
    answer:
      "Warehouse management software (WMS) is a platform that controls and optimises the movement of goods through a warehouse or distribution centre — from goods receipt and putaway through to picking, packing, and dispatch. A WMS tracks stock location and quantity in real time, automates task assignment to warehouse staff, integrates with barcodes and RFID readers, and feeds live inventory data back to connected ERP and order management systems.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does barcode and QR code tracking work in a warehouse?",
    answer:
      "Each stock-keeping unit (SKU), pallet, and bin location is labelled with a barcode or QR code at the point of receiving. Warehouse staff scan these labels with handheld mobile devices or fixed readers at key movement points — receiving, putaway, pick, pack, and dispatch. Each scan creates a timestamped transaction record that updates the live inventory position instantly, eliminating the lag and error of paper-based stock cards. The InOps platform supports standard 1D barcodes, QR codes, and RFID tags on the same mobile device.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is putaway, and how does InOps optimise it?",
    answer:
      "Putaway is the process of moving goods from the receiving dock to their designated storage location in the warehouse. InOps optimises putaway by assigning the nearest available bin based on SKU velocity (fast-moving items closer to the pick face), weight restrictions, and zone rules — all calculated at the moment of receipt. The mobile device guides the operative to the exact bin, eliminating search time and preventing misplacement that causes downstream inventory inaccuracies.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does InOps warehouse management integrate with ERP systems?",
    answer:
      "InOps WMS connects to ERP platforms — including SAP, Oracle, and Tally — via REST API and standard file-based connectors. Purchase orders and sales orders flow from the ERP into InOps automatically; stock movements, inventory balances, and despatch confirmations are written back in real time. This two-way sync means the ERP always reflects live warehouse stock without manual re-entry, and WMS task queues are always up to date with the latest orders.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between zone picking, batch picking, and wave picking?",
    answer:
      "Zone picking splits the warehouse into areas and assigns each picker to a fixed zone — orders are assembled across zones and consolidated at a merge point. Batch picking groups multiple orders into a single picker run, reducing travel for similar items. Wave picking releases a coordinated set of picks timed to a despatch window so picking, packing, and loading are synchronised. InOps supports all three strategies, and the dispatcher can configure which method applies to each order type or time window.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does InOps handle inventory accuracy and cycle counts?",
    answer:
      "InOps enables rolling cycle counts — systematic spot-checks of a subset of locations each day — rather than requiring a full annual stock-take. The system prioritises locations by discrepancy risk (high-velocity SKUs, locations flagged by recent scan anomalies) and generates count tasks automatically. Operatives scan and confirm quantities on their mobile device; variances are highlighted for supervisor approval before the inventory record is adjusted. InOps partners report 99.9% inventory accuracy after three months of live cycle counting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can InOps WMS track fixed assets like forklifts and biometric devices?",
    answer:
      "InOps warehouse management tracks the real-time location of movable warehouse equipment — forklifts, pallet trucks, scanners — within the warehouse floor. For enterprise fixed asset management covering AMC scheduling, depreciation, statutory audit records, and multi-site biometric device fleets, the dedicated",
