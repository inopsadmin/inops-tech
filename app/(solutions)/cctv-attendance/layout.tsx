    question: "What is camera-based attendance for contract workers in manufacturing?",
    answer:
      "Camera-based attendance uses face recognition via CCTV cameras or dedicated biometric terminals to record when contract workers enter and exit a manufacturing site. InOps links this attendance data to CLRA compliance records, contractor billing verification, and OT tracking — making it an audit-ready compliance record, not just a headcount log.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does camera attendance prevent proxy attendance for contract workers?",
    answer:
      "Proxy attendance (buddy punching) occurs when one worker clocks in on behalf of another. Camera-based face recognition with liveness detection prevents this by requiring the physical presence of the enrolled worker's face for each gate event. InOps CLMS flags any attempt to re-use an image or authenticate for a different enrolled worker.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can existing CCTV cameras be used for attendance tracking?",
    answer:
      "Yes. InOps CCTV-based attendance uses AI analytics on feeds from existing IP camera infrastructure to detect and identify workers as they enter a site. This allows plants to use their current camera investment for attendance without installing dedicated biometric terminals at every entry point.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does camera attendance connect to CLRA compliance?",
    answer:
      "Each camera attendance event in InOps CLMS is tagged to a specific contractor worker, their contractor agency, and their compliance status. The system tracks continuous attendance days (for the 9-day CLRA risk), minimum wage compliance per verified shift, and weekly off adherence — all from the camera attendance record.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does InOps support ZKTeco and other biometric devices alongside camera attendance?",
    answer:
      "Yes. InOps CLMS supports a mixed hardware environment — ZKTeco face and fingerprint terminals, CCTV-based AI attendance, and QR/card readers can all feed attendance events into the same CLMS record per worker. Multi-gate factories commonly deploy different hardware at different entry points with unified attendance in InOps.",
